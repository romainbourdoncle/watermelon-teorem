An interactive Python app developed to accompany the resolution of a math problem that is part of a wider pedagogical projet. The application uses Matplotlib to allow dynamic exploration of area constancy in a circle divided by rays from an interior movable point.

**Dynamic Geometry Exploration with Matplotlib**

**Description**
This Python application is part of the CSEN | GT3 initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive database of mathematical problems. It serves as an interactive educational tool to explore a specific geometry problem involving area constancy in a circle divided by rays from an interior movable point.

**Instructions for Running the Application**
**For Windows Users**
If you are using Windows, you can simply execute the provided .exe file to run the application.

**For macOS Users**
If you are using macOS, you need to run the code via the terminal. Here are the steps to do so:
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script.
2. Install required packages:
